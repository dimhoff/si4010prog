# asx8051 is the assembler provided with the SDCC tools. The options provided to the assembler are:
# Option 	Purpose
#  l 	generates a list file
#  o 	generates an object file
#  ff 	flag reallocatable references by mode in listing file
#  g 	make undefined symbols be global
#  p 	disables listing pagination
#
# The "o" option is mandatory, as the linker requires list, object and symbol files to generate executables. The "ff" and "p" options generate a readable list file. The "g" option tells the assembler to not generate an error if it finds an undefined symbol that is not declared as external.

#
# Option	Purpose
#  -i		Output Intel Hex
#  -m		Generate a map file
#  -b		Set base address of area
#  -e		end
#
#  WARNING: The <space> before the '-' in the echo(1) command is there on
#  purpose to prevent echo(1) from interpreting the '-' as an option(ie. '-e')
#  Yes, if your filename starts with a '-' it will also cause problems...
#
#  Sometimes sdld(1) returns with an error code but still generates the output
#  file. To fix this the extra rm(1) command is added on failure.
